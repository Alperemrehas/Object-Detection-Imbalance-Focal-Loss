# Object Detection with Focal Loss for the New Plant Disease Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Focal Loss for addressing class imbalance in object detection. The New Plant Disease Dataset is used as a real-world dataset for training and evaluating the object detection model.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.8)
- Miniconda (for environment management)
- PyTorch (>=1.8.1)
- torchvision (>=0.9.1)

Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

1. Dataset Preparation: Download and organize the New Plant Disease Dataset into train and test subsets. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

2. Adapt Code: Modify the code to load and work with the New Plant Disease Dataset, ensuring that annotations match your object detection model's requirements.

3. Training: Train the object detection model with the dataset using Focal Loss. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

4. Testing and Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and analyze the results.
